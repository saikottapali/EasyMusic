# EasyMusic
Our app offers an engaging and interactive approach to learning music, combining education with an enjoyable, game-like experience. Users can explore a variety of instruments, including trumpet, piano, and guitar, providing a well-rounded introduction to different musical styles.

To enhance the learning process, our app features dynamic visual aids tailored to each instrument, displaying chords, frets, and strings in real time. Each user will have a secure personal account with email and password protection, ensuring their progress is saved as they advance through their musical journey.

Inspired by the success of apps like Duolingo, we have incorporated progress tracking and gamified learning elements to keep users motivated and engaged. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refine your skills, our app makes learning music both effective and enjoyable.
