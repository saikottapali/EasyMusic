name: Cannot Mock DataLoader in Tests
about: Issues with mocking DataLoader.class in unit tests for UserList, MusicLibrary, and DataLoader
assignees: 'Bryson Sinclair'

---

**Describe the bug**
While trying to run tests that mock `DataLoader.class` and `DataWriter.class`, Mockito is unable to mock these classes, leading to test failures in `UserListTest`, `MusicLibraryTest`, and `DataLoaderTest`.

**Expected behavior**
Tests should be able to mock `DataLoader` classes successfully.

**Additional context**
- `UserListTest` and `MusicLibraryTest` fail to mock `DataLoader` and `DataWriter`.
- `DataLoaderTest` fails because Mockito cannot mock `DataLoader`.
- Possible that `DataWriterTest` is failing as well

name: Mismatch in Difficulty Level in `MusicCreationTest`
about: Difficulty level mismatch between expected and actual values in `MusicCreationTest`.
assignees: `Cameron Long`

---

**Describe the bug**
In `MusicCreationTest`, the test is failing due to a mismatch in the expected `difficultyLevel`. The test expects the difficulty level to be `<UNKNOWN>`, but it's getting `<null>` instead.


**Expected behavior**
The difficulty level should default to `<UNKNOWN>` if no valid input is provided, instead of being `null`.

**Additional context**
- The test case is validating the creation of a `Song` object, but the `difficultyLevel` is coming back as `null` rather than `<UNKNOWN>`.
- The expected behavior is for the `difficultyLevel` to be set to `<UNKNOWN>` if it's not explicitly provided.

name: Mockito Cannot Mock User Class in `DataWriterTest`
about: "Mockito cannot mock `User.class` in unit tests."
assignees: 'Savanna Welch'

---

**Describe the bug**
In `DataWriterTest`, Mockito is unable to mock the `User` class, which is causing the tests to fail. This issue is likely affecting other classes as well.


**Expected behavior**
Tests should be able to mock the `User` class and any other related classes.

**Additional context**
- `User` class might not be the only class that cannot be mocked

name: Mockito Cannot Mock `DataLoader` in `DataLoaderTest`
about: Mockito cannot mock `DataLoader` class in unit tests.
assignees: `Bryson Sinclair`

---

**Describe the bug**
`DataLoaderTest` fails because Mockito is unable to mock `DataLoader`. This prevents the tests from running as expected.

**Expected behavior**
The `DataLoader` class should be mockable in tests.

**Additional context**
- `DataLoader` class seems to have restrictions (e.g., `final` or `private` methods) that prevent it from being mocked.
- Investigate if `DataLoader` can be refactored or made more testable, possibly through interfaces or other design changes.
